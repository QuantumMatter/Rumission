description: |
    The LMP91000 is a programmable analog front-end (AFE)
    for use in micro-power electrochemical sensing
    applications. It provides a complete signal path solution
    between a sensor and a microcontroller that generates an
    output voltage proportional to the cell current

compatible: "ti,lmp91000"
